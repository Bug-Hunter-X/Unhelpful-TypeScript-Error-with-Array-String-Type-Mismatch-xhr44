# Unhelpful TypeScript Error with Array/String Type Mismatch

This example demonstrates a common yet subtly confusing TypeScript error that occurs when an array is passed to a function expecting a string. The error message generated by the compiler can be misleading, making debugging more challenging than it needs to be. 

## Bug

The `greeter` function is designed to accept a string and return a greeting. However, when an array is passed as an argument, TypeScript throws an error, but the error message isn't always clear about the root cause.
